Often times, you'll see arguments on Stack Overflow follow the generic layout:

> User: Your question is a duplicate of [other post]
>
> Author: No, it's not.

In this scenario, the User mentions an existing question that they believe has already been asked and answered.

The Author then visits the question and after briefly reading the question and copy-pasting all of the answers to see if they work, the Author fires back with:

> It's not a duplicate post, the question didn't help me.

There's a problem here, and it some sense the finger of blame could be passed to more than one culprit here.

![Looking at you.](/images/blame.jpg)

In this situation, the problem will be one of two things

>
 - A) The post is _NOT_ a duplicate, and the User that suggested it will be ignored by the reviewers and post Author.
>
   _So long as others don't blindly vote to close, problem solved._
>
 - B) The post is a duplicate, but the Author doesn't know it.

Problem B is the more troublesome issue, and can be broken up into three issues:

>
 - X) The User who suggests the duplication doesn't do a good enough job explaining _how_ it is a duplicate.
 - Y) The Community doesn't do a good enough effort to close the post,
 - Z) The Author doesn't recognise that it is a duplicate

I like to call Point _Z_ the "Programming Personal Fable".

In Psychology, Personal Fable is defined as "_a belief held by many adolescents telling them that they are special and unique, so much so that none of life's difficulties or problems will affect them regardless of their behavior._" <sup>[From here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2614649)</sup>

I like to imagine this as caused by either the naivety (and inexperience) of the Author, or the juvenile belief in their work as "Personal Fable"-esque proportions.

There's absolutely no way that Stack Overflow's [Army of Infinite Monkeys on typewriters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) could write something along the same lines.

So, if you're a user who gets involved in a duplicate discussion, take the time and discuss _why_ it's a duplicate.
