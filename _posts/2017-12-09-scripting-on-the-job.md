Once of the most important parts about being a programmer (especially once dealing with the web), is growing and evolving.

Every company wants staff that are talented and trained in a hundred areas, but *very few* are willing to train staff to get there.

One of the ways that I've taken to mitigate this gap is to script.

For any business, automation is an asset. Anything that can be done by machine over man is generally a cost saver.

Say, for instance, you're not very familiar with *PowerShell*. You can use your situation as a chance to automate away some of your work and learn a language at the same time.... Or maybe you're on **macOS**, and you learn *AppleScript* or *Ruby*. Maybe even you're a web designer, and you can use [*Stylish*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) or [*UserScripts*](https://tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) to script changes.

Many people hate the concept of a "*Rockstar*" developer, but this is one of the ways to get the kind of talent that would make you one. (You can choose whether to apply the Ego.)

On my last job, I spent time to learn more about PowerShell, Postgres & SQL Server internals amongst other things.

The time spent did not only create valuable automating scripts for the business, but also gave me valuable skills to add to my programer utility belt.
