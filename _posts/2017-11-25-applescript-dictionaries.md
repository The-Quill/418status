`AppleScript` has traditionally been an (admittedly funny) joke in most circles I've been in.

Even jokes have a purpose sometimes, and if you're on a mac there's no reason you can't take advantage of it.

`AppleScript` can be called from the command line, meaning that IO can be provided to other languages or environments.

Some of your `macOS` apps have `AppleScript` dictionaries built in that show you reference to be used:

These dictionaries look similar to this:

and come with `JavaScript`, `Objective-C` and (probably, haven't confirmed yet) `Swift` library references to use.

This is pretty handy for acting on native applications and building cool stuff.
